# Runners

A runner is a server that runs your workflows when they're triggered. Each runner can run a single job at a time.

GitHub provides Ubuntu Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS runners to run your workflows; each workflow run executes in a fresh, newly-provisioned virtual machine.

GitHub also offers larger runners, which are available in larger configurations.
