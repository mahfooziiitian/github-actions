# Events

An event is a specific activity in a repository that triggers a workflow run.

For example, activity can originate from GitHub when someone creates a pull request, opens an issue, or pushes a commit to a repository.

You can also trigger a workflow to run on a schedule, by posting to a REST API, or manually.
