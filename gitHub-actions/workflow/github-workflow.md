# Workflows

A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs.

Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.

Workflows are defined in the `.github/workflows` directory in a repository, and a repository can have multiple workflows, each of which can perform a different set of tasks.

For example, you can have one workflow to build and test pull requests, another workflow to deploy your application every time a release is created, and still another workflow that adds a label every time someone opens a new issue.

You can reference a workflow within another workflow.
